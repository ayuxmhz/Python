number=[(5,7,8,10) ,(20)]#immutable value the can't be changed or modify # if we put tuple inside the list then tuples index  works differently before (5,7,8,10) print(number[0]) gave 5 after added after inside the list the tuple [(5,7),(20)]=(5,7) are both in index 0 
# number[0]=2#it will give error / can't be change 
print(number[1])#output as we put the index right output = 5 at index 0 
print(number)#useful for immutable
